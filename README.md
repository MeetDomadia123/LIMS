# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview: Electronics Lab Inventory Management System (LIMS)

Welcome to the official documentation for our submission to the **A-1 Launchpad 2025 Case Study**.

This project addresses the challenge of managing and tracking electronic components in a lab environment, replacing traditional error-prone manual logs with a modern, intelligent, and user-friendly system.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement
> Manual tracking of electronics inventory is prone to errors, time-consuming, and lacks real-time insight.

Labs often face:
- Stockouts due to inaccurate logs
- Lack of accountability
- Wastage from expired/unused components
- Delays in project execution

---

## ðŸ§  Our Solution: Smart LIMS

A full-stack digital solution built with modern technologies and enhanced by automation and analytics.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features

1. **ðŸ“¦ Component Management**  
   Admins can add, update, and search for components with detailed metadata including part number, quantity, location, and manufacturer.

2. **ðŸ“² QR-Based Movement Logging**  
   Each component bin is labeled with a QR code. Using a built-in scanner:
   - Scan the QR code
   - Choose **Inward** (add stock) or **Outward** (issue component)
   - Enter quantity and reason
   - Inventory auto-updates in real time

3. **ðŸ§¾ Transaction History**  
   Every action is logged in a `transactions` table, tracking who did what, when, and why. This ensures complete traceability and audit-readiness.

4. **ðŸ“Š Grafana Dashboard Integration**  
   Real-time analytics and alerting with Grafana:
   - Low stock alerts
   - Daily/weekly issue trends
   - Old unused stock listing
   - Visualized usage patterns

5. **ðŸ’¬ Chatbot Assistant (Dialogflow)**  
   For non-technical users like students/researchers:
   - Ask: "Do we have Arduino Uno?"
   - Bot replies with quantity and location
   - Reduces learning curve for users unfamiliar with the dashboard
